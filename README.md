Very simple but cool Matrix style pesonalized message...

## Needed:

- ### Install **"unimatrix"** to have Katana font Matrix style effect;
  Or replace unimatrix with "cmatrix" in the code ... but unimatrix is better :)
  
    Replace >>    system("unimatrix -f -b -l k -s 95 -t 8")
    
    With >>       system("cmatrix")

  and print the line one letter at time (typing)
  ### it stop read lines when find a character ";"
